# Jellyfin Rewind

## Welcome to Jellyfin Rewind 2023!

### How to use

Because Jellyfin Rewind is web-based and (for now at least) not available as a plugin, it might be a bit tricky to get your browser to communicate with your Jellyfin server. The problem is that browsers won't allow "insecure" requests (http) from a "secure" website (http**s**).

Therefore, **if you're unsure what your Jellyfin server is using, simply use the first link** (http)!

### Links

**HTTP** (works for both http and https Jellyfin servers, but some things might not work correctly):

<http://jellyfin-rewind-http.chaphasilor.xyz>

**HTTPS** (if your Jellyfin server has an https connection, this is the best experience):

<https://jellyfin-rewind.chaphasilor.xyz>

### Download your Rewind report!

**Please, please, please download your Rewind report at the end!**

Jellyfin's statistics aren't very exhaustive, and any additional data could help offer you more insights during next year's Rewind! Especially if you don't have the *Playback Reporting* plugin installed, this year's Rewind report might come in very handy, so keep it safe!

If something doesn't work and you can't download the data, I'll be happy to help you resolve the issue.

### How does it work?

Glad you asked!  
Essentially, Jellyfin Rewind loads most of the information about your music from your Jellyfin server, processes it on your device, aggregates some nice statistics, and then shows the result to you!

Your data never leaves your device; it's very similar to using the Jellyfin app on your phone.

Sadly the build in statistics of Jellyfin are pretty lackluster as of now, even with the *Playback Reporting* plugin, so that *a lot* of data has to be processed on your device. That's why it takes a few seconds to generate your Rewind report.

For next year, I might release a separate plugin that can use your Jellyfin server in order to crunch the data. This would also solve some of the connection problems that might happen this year. If you're interested in helping me with the plugin, please be sure to reach out!

### Can I help out somehow?

If you know something about web development, are a designer of some sorts, or have experience (or are curious about) developing Jellyfin plugins, I'd love to hear from you! There's so much I want to implement for next year's Jellyfin Rewind, and I need your help to bring all these ideas to life!

I had many more features planned for this year, but simply didn't have the time. I originally planned to launch back in November, and that obviously didn't work out :)

Thanks to everyone who uses Jellyfin Rewind, I sincerely hope you enjoyed it as much as I did!  
See you next year!!!
