# Jellyfin Rewind

## Welcome to Jellyfin Rewind 2022!

## How to use

Because Jellyfin Rewind is web-based and (for now at least) not available as a plugin, it might be a bit tricky to get your browser to communicate with your Jellyfin server. The problem is that browsers won't allow "insecure" requests (http) from a "secure" website (http**s**).

Therefore, **if you're unsure what your Jellyfin server is using, simply use the first link** (http)!

## Links

**HTTP** (works for both http and https Jellyfin servers, but some things might not work correctly):

<http://jellyfin-rewind-http.chaphasilor.xyz>

**HTTPS** (if your Jellyfin server has an https connection, this is the best experience):

<https://jellyfin-rewind.chaphasilor.xyz>
